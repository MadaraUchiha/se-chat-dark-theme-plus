# StackExchange Chat Dark Theme Plus!

This is the new home for rlemon's dark theme. 

restyled Olivers original and added a bunch of JS "features".   

Why the change? The re-write of this is more modular and I didn't feel like managing a new branch.

Only tested in Chrome. FireFox is on the roadmap. IE is smelly and will not get support. 

### Usage 

Available for Chrome here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/so-dark-chat-%20/bbkjccfnenmgidehjhaabamobpbaaghh
